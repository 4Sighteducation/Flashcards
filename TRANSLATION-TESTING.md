# Translation and Multiple Choice Testing Guide

This guide helps you test the recent fixes for translation issues and multiple choice option rendering in the Flashcards application.

## What was fixed?

1. **Multiple Choice Option Rendering**
   - Fixed display issues with multiple choice options
   - Added error handling for cards without options
   - Improved styling of options with better accessibility

2. **Translation Service Improvements**
   - Added rate limit handling to prevent "Too many requests" errors
   - Implemented request throttling (delay between API calls)
   - Added fallback mechanisms between Welsh and LibreTranslate APIs
   - Improved caching to reduce redundant API calls
   - Better error handling with automatic retries

3. **AutoTranslatedText Component Enhancements**
   - Added local caching to store successful translations
   - Added loading indicators during translation
   - Improved error handling with visible feedback
   - Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff

## How to Test the Fixes

### Testing from the Browser Console

We've added a testing utility that can be run from your browser console:

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Run the test command:
   ```javascript
   testMultipleChoiceAndTranslation()
   ```

This will test:
- Welsh translation functionality
- Multiple choice option rendering
- Translation throttling mechanism

### Manual Testing

#### Multiple Choice Options

1. Create a new flashcard with type "Multiple Choice"
2. Add at least 3-4 options
3. Save the card and verify all options display correctly
4. Try expanding a subject/topic with multiple choice cards to verify rendering

#### Translation Functionality

1. Change the language to Welsh using the language selector
2. Verify that UI elements (headers, titles, buttons) are translated
3. Create a new card with English content
4. Verify the card content is automatically translated when viewed in Welsh
5. Check that no "Too many requests" errors appear in the console

#### Rate Limiting Prevention

To test rate limiting prevention:
1. Open browser console
2. Run this command to simulate multiple quick translations:
   ```javascript
   testMultipleChoiceAndTranslation({testWelsh: true, testOptions: false})
   ```
3. Verify that translations are properly throttled (delayed) rather than failing

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

### For Multiple Choice Options Not Displaying:
- Check the card data to ensure it has a `questionType` of "multiple_choice"
- Verify the card has an `options` array with at least one option
- Check browser console for any errors related to option rendering

### For Translation Issues:
- Verify your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file:
  ```
  REACT_APP_WELSH_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_key_here
  REACT_APP_WELSH_TRANSLATE_API=http://api.techiaith.org/translate-smt/v1/
  REACT_APP_WELSH_TRANSLATE_ENGINE=CofnodYCynulliad
  ```
- Check browser console for any API error responses
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading the application

If issues persist, check the detailed error messages in the browser console for additional troubleshooting guidance.
